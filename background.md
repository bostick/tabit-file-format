what is TabIt ?


everything is on a grid!




## the crisis

when the forum went down


Update as of Feb. 26, 2020:

Sorry for the continued delay, folks. Work has begun on getting the Tablature Area ready, but finding the time to complete the job has proven difficult. Still no ETA yet, I'm afraid. This page will be updated again when there is more progress to report.

And FYI, this server move was not planned. It had to happen because the previous hosting provider shut down their data center on relatively short notice.

reverse engineering TabIt files

Since I have a copy of TabIt and I can run it, then an easy approach is to save different files while changing only 1 thing and see what the difference is.

save various files:

notes 012345 on 1 string

notes 012345 on another string


just change tempo


etc.




ask for help with IDA Pro / Ghidra









is it legal to reverse-engineer file formats?
