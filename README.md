# The .tbt TabIt file format

TabIt is a Windows application that is described in its [website](http://www.tabit.net) as

> a full-featured program for creating, playing, and printing guitar, bass, or banjo tablature.

TabIt is effectively abandonware.

The latest version of TabIt, version 2.03, was released in 2006.

I will be adding more tools such as .tbt file parsers for various languages.
